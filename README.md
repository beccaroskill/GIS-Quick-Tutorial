# GIS-Tutorial
### GIS tutorial with very surface-level examples using geopandas and arcgis libraries

Run the tutorial (a Python notebook) to check out the following examples:
1) Seattle Roads (simple geoprocessing with vector layers with geopandas)
2) Feature class to .csv (from GIS to simple row data with geographical info with
 geopandas)
3) Raster images in ArcGIS (downloading rasterdata with arcgis)


Requirements:
- pandas
- geopandas
- mapclassify
- folium
- markupsafe==2.0.1 (folium is being finicky right now)
- arcgis
